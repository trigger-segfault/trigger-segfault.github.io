    description: "Trigger's RCT2 Tools is a small collection of stylish and functional tools for use with Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. Each tool is designed to be easy to use and requires little to no low level knowledge about the game. Many of the older tools for the game are much lower level, and thus harder to use."

    image: /tools/previews/triggers-pc.png
    description: "I play Gen 3 a lot and I decided hoarding Pokémon and items was a pain when storage space was so limited, that and trading takes forever. So I created a PokéBank-like program for hoarding, trading, and managing Pokémon, Items, Pokéblocks, Mail, and Decorations. Trigger's PC is a tool designed for legit purposes. There really aren't enough tools for legit-play out there sadly. However, note it does extend some of the boundaries of the game to increase replayability and customization."

    title: "Unlimited Steamworks"
    url: https://github.com/trigger-segfault/UnlimitedSteamworks
    image: /tools/previews/unlimited-steamworks.png
    description: "A launcher for Steam apps to signal Steam activity, protect against crashing apps breaking relaunching, and circumventing Steam's terrible command line argument security measures. Unlimited Steamworks is for launching Steam games without the use of the Steam client. All issues aside from the 2nd point are moot when a game is launched via the Steam client."

    title: "jpcmd"
    url: https://github.com/trigger-segfault/jpcmd
    image: /tools/previews/jpcmd.png
    description: "A Command Prompt launcher that sets the codepage to Shift JIS (932) for proper Japanese program output. All command line arguments passed to jpcmd.exe are passed directly to cmd.exe. Setting the path to Locale Emulator's LEProc.exe in the config.ini file will allow launching the program through jpcmdle.exe to make sure all programs launched from jpcmd.exe keep their Japanese locale. The reason for this feature is that even when running cmd.exe through Locale Emulator, the codepage will not be set to Shift JIS (932), making the output practically useless."

    image: /tools/previews/hourglasspass.png

A web app to generate passwords is planned for the future."
