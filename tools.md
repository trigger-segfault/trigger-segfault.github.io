    image: /tools/previews/triggers-pc.png
    description: "I play Gen 3 a lot and I decided hoarding Pokémon and items was a pain when storage space was so limited, that and trading takes forever. So I created a PokéBank-like program for hoarding, trading, and managing Pokémon, Items, Pokéblocks, Mail, and Decorations. Trigger's PC is a tool designed for legit purposes. There really aren't enough tools for legit-play out there sadly. However, note it does extend some of the boundaries of the game to increase replayability and customization."
