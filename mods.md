    title: "Skyrim: Ore Veins Mined"

    image: /mods/previews/ore-veins-mined.png
    description: "This mod adds a stat for tracking ore veins mined. It can be found in the statistics menu in the crafting section. The statistic will not count any ore veins you mined before adding this mod. This is a statistic that I always thought the game needed. It's a slow and unlucrative process and there's no reason to do it late-game when you can buy the ore in bulk. At least now you can get the satisfaction of knowing you incremented a counter in the game while wasting 10 whole seconds for 9 gold worth of iron ore."
