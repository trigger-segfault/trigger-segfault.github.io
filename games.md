    description: "ReEntry is a top down arcade style bullet hell where the player plays as a virus trying to infect a computer and reach its system 32 files. An area based open travel system similar to that in games like gauntlet will be used as the setting, with the player being able to take some of the enemies powers to help them complete levels. The player starts in the downloads folder and must travel through the computer to get to its destination. Each level in the game is a directory in the computer, to advance to the next directory the player must defeat all enemies in the room. The game takes place in three areas of the computer: The user directory, the registry, and the windows directory. At the end of each area is a boss guarding the shortcut."

Rule 1) All Tetrominos are red, white, and blue. Rule 2) Rock music must be playing at all times. Rule 3) Stars must fly out when a Tetromino lands."
