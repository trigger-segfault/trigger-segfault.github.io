Now that I'm running my GitHub Pages site through Jekyll, I may as well take advantage of the blog feature and update this thing every so often. So, have a blog post about my first post. :)

Editing out the text "Pic" in this CG took quite some time. But I'm happy with the result, even if you can clearly see it's modified near the "o" in "Post". Source is [Grisaia no Meikyuu](https://vndb.org/v7723).
